# Twitter Clone

This project mimicks some of the twitter functionality and is in development

## Getting Started

Local development workflow: 
: **Client Folder**
For my workflow, I have the node module live-server serving up the client files. I run this server by running ```live-server``` in the client directory.
: **Server Folder**
To startup the server for development, execute ```npm run dev``` in the server folder. The dev script utilizes nodemon which auto reloads server whenever changes are made to it.


### Prerequisites

* live-server
* nodemon

```
Give examples of instillation
```



## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
